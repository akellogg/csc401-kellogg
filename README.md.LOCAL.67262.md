Semester Project Proposal

DESCRIPTION
I would like to create a weather app this semester. I want to create a weather app that is 
both functional and readable as well as visually appealing to the user. Users will be able
to see the forecast and receive push notifications for weather warnings.

FEATURES
Some features will include push notifications for weather warnings & viewing the forecast.

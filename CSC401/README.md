DESCRIPTION
I will be creating a weather app this semester that is both visually appealing and 
functional.


FEATURES
- Ability to save up to 5 locations
	- Search for locations by zip code or city, state
	- Ability to save a location as "favorite" or "default" - this location appears as the
	"homepage" when you open the app
	- Swipe to the right (like in the Facebook app) to see a list of other saved locations.
- Ability to see a 5 day forecast and alerts
- Current weather and temperature, hi/lo for the day, wind, humidity, chance of
precipitation, sunrise/sunset
- Settings page
	- Add/delete locations and set "favorite" location
	- Choose unit options
		- Imperial (US - F/mph/miles/inches)
		- Metric (World - C/millimeters/km/kph/millibars)
		- Hybrid (UK - C/millimeters/miles/mph/millibars)
